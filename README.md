## Summary
This code and data is used to build a sample website, with interactive elements, so the user can look at a sample group's data in a clear and understandable way.

Identifying information has been stripped from the participants, with names replaces with key numbers.

Information from the study shown in summary is ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and (belly button)washing frequency. Charts show the ID number for various bacteria, concentrations/quantity found, and a scale showing washing frequency.
